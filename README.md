#How to run from repo

SETUP:
clone repo into project folder, assest.zip should be extracted 
to the folder above the code files.

Install pygame using
"pip3 install pygame" 
This is what the game runs on

Install pytmx using
"pip3 install pytmx"
This is what allows pygame to run .tmx files i.e your map and tilesets

You can expand and add different elements using Tiled by installing using
sudo snap install tiled

run 'python3 main.py' from your code directory.
